# Getting started

## Ribosome profiling with Bayesian predictions

We propose an unsupervised Bayesian approach to predict translated open reading frames (ORFs) from ribosome profiles. We rely on MCMC sampling using `Stan` to estimate posterior distributions
of the likelihood of translation for each identified ORF. We implement an automatic Bayesian Periodic fragment length and ribosome P-site offset Selection (BPPS), *i.e.* read lengths and ribosome P-site offsets are inferred from the data, without supervision. Hence our method is able to handle *de novo* translatome annotation by directly assessing the periodicity of the Ribo-seq signal.

### Supported operating systems

Our workflow was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux, including the Ubuntu distribution.
macOS is currently not fully supported.

### Installation

`rpbp` is written in Python3. The package is not currently published on PyPI, but the installation
is done through `pip`, after cloning the Git repository. Note that `pip` will not install external dependencies
that are required to run the pipeline. Supported versions of Python and major dependencies are specified in each release.

For detailed instructions, refer to [installation](installation.html).

### Usage

For detailed usage instructions, refer to [Running the Rp-Bp pipeline step-by-step](usage-instructions.html).
For quality control and visualisation of the results, see [QC and downstream analysis of the Rp-Bp results](analysis-scripts.html).

To get started, the package also includes a small example using a *C. elegans* dataset.
To run the example, refer to [Running Rp-Bp on the example dataset](running-example.html).
