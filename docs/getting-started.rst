Getting started
###############

**Rp-Bp** can be used for ORF discovery, or simply to estimate periodicity in a set of Ribo-seq replicates, to know which samples and read lengths are usable for downstream analyses.

To get started, you need *(i)* Ribo-seq data (FASTQ), *(ii)* genome sequence and annotation for your organism (FASTA, GTF), and *(iii)* ribosomal sequences for *in-silico* rRNA removal (FASTA). We also recommend to filter protocol-specific or general adapter sequences, this can be done by providing a FASTA file containing a set of adapter sequences.

Containers
**********

The quickly get started, the preferred way is to use a Docker container with **Rp-Bp** pre-installed:

.. code-block:: bash
    docker pull ...


.. _getting_started_install:

Installation
************

Supported operating systems
---------------------------

Debian GNU/Linux and macOS.


To install from Bioconda using Conda, set up `Bioconda <https://bioconda.github.io/#usage>`_ or `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ if not already done, then:

.. code-block:: bash
    conda install rpbp

The Conda installation will resolve all package dependencies.


**Rp-Bp** is also available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/rpbp>`_, but required dependencies are not installed automatically, and must be installed prior to running the pipeline.


For detailed instructions, refer to `Installation <installation.html>`_.


General usage
*************

For detailed usage instructions, refer to `Running the pipeline <usage.html>`_.
For visualisation and quality control, see `Visualisation and quality control <apps.html>`_.

To get started, the package also includes a small example using a *C. elegans* dataset.
To run the example, refer to `Tutorial <tutorial.html>`_.
